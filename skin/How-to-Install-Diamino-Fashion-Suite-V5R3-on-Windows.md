## What is Diamino?
 
Diamino is a software that helps you create and optimize markers for your garments. A marker is a layout of patterns on a piece of fabric that minimizes waste and maximizes efficiency. Diamino allows you to import patterns from Modaris or other CAD software, or create them from scratch using its built-in tools. You can then adjust the parameters of the marker, such as fabric width, grain direction, shrinkage, buffer, etc. Diamino will automatically generate the optimal marker for you, or you can manually edit it if you prefer. You can also compare different markers and see how much fabric you can save with each one.
 
Diamino has many features that make it a powerful and user-friendly software for marker making. Some of these features are:

- Automatic nesting: Diamino uses advanced algorithms to place the patterns on the fabric in the most efficient way possible.
- Interactive nesting: You can manually move, rotate, flip or align the patterns on the fabric using your mouse or keyboard.
- Multi-core nesting: Diamino can use multiple processors or cores of your computer to speed up the nesting process.
- Multi-model nesting: Diamino can nest patterns from different models or sizes on the same fabric.
- Multi-fabric nesting: Diamino can nest patterns on different fabrics with different properties and constraints.
- Multi-layer nesting: Diamino can nest patterns on multiple layers of fabric at once.
- Pattern matching: Diamino can match the patterns according to their seams, stripes, checks, motifs or logos.
- Marker reports: Diamino can generate detailed reports on the marker, such as fabric consumption, efficiency, cost, etc.

## What is Justprint?
 
Justprint is a software that helps you print your markers on paper or plotter. It is integrated with Diamino and Modaris, so you can easily send your markers to Justprint and print them with the correct settings and scale. Justprint supports various types of printers and plotters, and allows you to customize the printing options, such as paper size, orientation, margins, etc. You can also preview the marker before printing it and check for any errors or warnings.
 
Justprint has many features that make it a reliable and convenient software for printing markers. Some of these features are:

- Automatic scaling: Justprint can automatically adjust the scale of the marker to fit the paper size.
- Automatic rotation: Justprint can automatically rotate the marker to optimize the paper usage.
- Automatic splitting: Justprint can automatically split the marker into smaller pieces if it is too large for the paper size.
- Automatic tiling: Justprint can automatically tile the marker if it is too large for the plotter width.
- Automatic alignment: Justprint can automatically align the pieces of the marker if it is split or tiled.
- Automatic numbering: Justprint can automatically number the pieces of the marker for easy identification and assembly.
- Printing queue: Justprint can manage multiple printing jobs and print them in sequence or in parallel.
- Printing history: Justprint can keep track of the printing jobs and their status and details.
